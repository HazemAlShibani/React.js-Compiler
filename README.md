## Overview
A custom React.js compiler built entirely by a React.js developer! ðŸ˜„ <br/>
i accomplished this project by completing these steps: <br/>
Writing  the Lexer and Parser Grammar. <br/>
Building the AST Classes. <br/>
Building the Vistors. <br/>
Handling the Syntax and Semantic Errors. <br/>
Dealing with Code Generation (convert React.js Code to The Native Languages). <br/>

You can find the source code attached which contains: <br/>
  *src* directory: contains the whole programming files. <br/>
  *tests* directory: contains the test files (e.g: test1.txt) and these files are checked by the compiler, So you can see the results in GenTests directory and the terminal. <br/>

## Technical information
â€¢Â **ANTLR Integration**: Leveraging ANTLR for robust grammar parsing and tokenization. <br/>
â€¢Â **Java Backend**: Utilizing Java for efficient compilation processes. <br/>
â€¢Â **Continuous Error Handling**: Implementing both syntax and semantic error detection for improved code quality. <br/>
â€¢Â **AST Generation**: Creating Abstract Syntax Trees for comprehensive code analysis. <br/>
 â€¢Â **React Grammar Implementation**: Defining and enforcing React-specific grammar rules. <br/>
 â€¢Â **Code Generation**: Automatically generating optimized React components. <br/>
